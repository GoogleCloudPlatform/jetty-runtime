# Development Guide

This document contains instructions on how to build and test this image.

## Building the Jetty image

### Local build
To build the image you need git, docker and maven installed:
```console
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/jetty-runtime.git
cd jetty-runtime
mvn clean install
```

### Cloud build
To build using the [Google Cloud Container Builder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs/overview), you need to have git, maven, and the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) installed locally.
```console
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/jetty-runtime.git
cd jetty-runtime

# initiate the cloud build, passing in the docker namespace and tag for the resulting image
PROJECT_ID=my-project
TAG=my-tag
./scripts/build.sh gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID $TAG
```

If you would like to simulate the cloud build locally, pass in the `--local` argument.
```
./scripts/build.sh gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID $TAG --local
```

## Running the Jetty image
The resulting image is called jetty (with more specific tags also created)
and can be run with:
```console
docker run jetty
```

## Running Tests
Integration tests can be run via [Google Cloud Container Builder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs/overview). 
These tests deploy a sample test application to App Engine using the provided runtime image, and 
exercise various integrations with other GCP services. Note that the image under test must be pushed 
to a gcr.io repository before the integration tests can run.

```bash
RUNTIME_IMAGE=gcr.io/my-project-id/jetty:my-tag
gcloud docker -- push $RUNTIME_IMAGE
./scripts/integration_test.sh $RUNTIME_IMAGE
```
Note that these tests are different and complementary to the integration tests in the `/tests` 
directory. See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for more detail.
