== 13. Debugging tools

Dandelion-Core ships some live debugging tools that you may find useful during development.

=== 13.1. Alert reporting

Since Dandelion-Core relies on asset bundles, it is extremely important to have quick feedback on potential errors when including bundles. Since the v1.0.0, Dandelion-Core has a basic alert reporting tool that will help you to debug as fast as possible.

==== 13.1.1. Alert types

For now, only missing bundle will be reported but it will be enhanced in future versions.

==== 13.1.2. Reporting mode

Several reporting modes are at your disposal:

* *console*: any alert will be displayed in the JavaScript console of your browser
* *notification*: a notification will be fired client-side
* *all* (default in both *dev* and *prod* profiles): equivalent of *console* + *notification*
* *none*: disables client-side alert reporting

The choice is set via the <<opt-tool.alert.reporting.mode, `tool.alert.reporting.mode`>> configuration option.

===== Example

In order to report alerts in the JavaScript console only, modify the configuration file as follows:

.dandelion/dandelion.properties
[source, properties]
----
tool.alert.reporting.mode = console
----

NOTE: All alerts are reported in a dedicated debug page, inside the debugger. See the next section for more information.

==== 13.1.3. Enabling/disabling alert reporting

The reporting system can be enabled/disabled thanks to the <<opt-tool.alert.reporting, `tool.alert.reporting`>> configuration option.

For example, in order to disable the reporting system, modify the configuration file as follows:

.dandelion/dandelion.properties
[source, properties]
----
tool.alert.reporting = false
----

=== 13.2. Live debugger

In order to access the debugger, just append the following request parameter to the current URL: `ddl-debug`.

For example, if you are browsing the JSP starter sample at the URL: http://localhost:8080/core-jsp-starter/, just modify the URL as follows: http://localhost:8080/core-jsp-starter/?ddl-debug. 

As a consequence, Dandelion-Core will display the debugger and show information about the current request.

NOTE: Access to the debugger can be disabled thanks to the <<opt-tool.debugger, `tool.debugger`>> configuration option.

The Dandelion debugger is composed of several _debug pages_, which are described below.

==== 13.2.1. Current assets

This debug page allows you to understand how Dandelion-Core handles the included bundles. Several views are available:

* graph: shows in a graph view what bundles are included in the current request
* table: shows the same in a table view
* HTML: shows how Dandelion-Core will generate HTML markup and where tags are to be included

==== 13.2.2. Current options

This debug page shows:

* the active profile
* all current active configuration options

==== 13.2.3. Asset storage

This debug page shows all assets stored in the asset storage, and all related metadata: version, parent bundle, ...

==== 13.2.4. Bundle storage

This debug page shows all bundles stored in the bundle storage. Two views are available:

* a *graph* view

* a *tabular* view 

+

Note that the tabular view also displays more metadata about bundles: the original bundle loader (note that a `vendor` tag is displayed for vendor bundles), all bundle dependencies and the bundle original path.

==== 13.2.5. Cache store

This debug page lets you visualize the contents of the cache store, that is all associations between request URIs and required assets.

==== 13.2.6. Alert reporting

This debug page lets you visualize all alerts reported by Dandelion-Core.

Note that when a requested bundle doesn't exist in the bundle storage, Dandelion-Core checks whether any bundle exists with the same name. If so, all suggested bundles will be displayed in the last column.
