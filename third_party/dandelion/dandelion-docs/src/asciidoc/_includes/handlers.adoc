== 14. Request/response handlers

As briefly explained in the <<1-3-overall-functioning, introduction>>, Dandelion-Core is mainly based on a http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/Filter.html[servlet filter]: `DandelionFilter`. As most of existing filters, it is used to preprocess requests and postprocess responses, but in a modular manner that will be described in this section. 

=== 14.1. Pre-handlers, post-handlers and handler chain

The `DandelionFilter` does not directly processes requests and responses but delegates to a set of handlers. As the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/filters-137243.html[filter chain of the Servlet API], Dandelion-Core builds a handler chain at startup, which provides the same kind of mechanism as filters but for invoking a series of handlers, in a particular order.

A good sketch is better than words: 

image::handlers.png[Handler chain, align=center]

Note however that handlers fall into two categories:

* *pre-handlers*: in charge of preprocessing requests
* *post-handlers*: in charge of postprocessing responses

Each handler has its own role, which will be detailed in the next section.

=== 14.2. Built-in pre-handlers

==== 14.2.1. `ReloadBundlePreHandler`

[cols="3,^1,10a,10"]
|===
|Type |Rank |Condition(s) |Role

|Pre-handler 
|0 
|* <<opt-tool.bundle.reloading, `tool.bundle.reloading`>> enabled
* `ddl-reload-bundles` present as a request parameter
|Reset the internal bundle storage by scanning all bundles and feed the bundle graph
|===

Note that the <<13-2-live-debugger, debugger>> has a _Quick actions_ menu that trigger the bundle reloading using the above parameter.

==== 14.2.2. `ClearCachePreHandler`

[cols="3,^1,10a,10"]
|===
|Type |Rank |Condition(s) |Role

|Pre-handler 
|0 
|* <<opt-tool.debugger, `tool.debugger`>> enabled
* `ddl-clear-cache` present as a request parameter
|Clear the configured <<9-2-built-in-server-side-cache-systems, cache system>>
|===

==== 14.2.3. `ClearStoragePreHandler`

[cols="3,^1,10a,10"]
|===
|Type |Rank |Condition(s) |Role

|Pre-handler 
|0 
|* <<opt-tool.debugger, `tool.debugger`>> enabled
* `ddl-clear-storage` present as a request parameter
|Clear the configured asset storage system
|===

NOTE: Note that the rank of built-in pre-handlers doesn't matter, since they're all used to perform one shot actions.

=== 14.3. Built-in post-handlers

==== 14.3.1. `ProcessJsPostHandler` (Thymeleaf only)

[cols="3,^1,10a,10"]
|===
|Type |Rank |Condition(s) |Role

|Post-handler 
|2 
|* <<opt-asset.js.processing, `asset.js.processing`>> enabled
* The content type must be compatible*
|Processes any Thymeleaf expression in JavaScript assets. Note that request attributes are also made available when processing the assets
|===

*Compatible content types: `application/x-javascript`, `application/javascript`, `text/javascript`, `text/ecmascript`, `application/ecmascript`, `text/jscript`

This handler is automatically registered when using Thymeleaf.

==== 14.3.2. `ETagPostHandler`

[cols="3,^1,10a,10"]
|===
|Type |Rank |Condition(s) |Role

|Pre-handler 
|10 
|All content types except `text/html`
|Sends a HTTP 304 (NOT MODIFIED) if the request ETag equals the response ETag, thus saving bandwith (not server performance)
|===

==== 14.3.3. `AssetInjectionPostHandler`

[cols="3,^1,10a,10"]
|===
|Type |Rank |Condition(s) |Role

|Pre-handler 
|20
|`text/html` content type only
|Perform the asset injection within HTTP responses
|===

==== 14.3.4. `GzipCompressionPostHandler`

[cols="3,^1,10a,10"]
|===
|Type |Rank |Condition(s) |Role

|Pre-handler 
|30 
|* <<opt-tool.gzip, `tool.gzip`>> enabled
* The brower must accept the gzip encoding
* The response is not commited
* The request is not an `INCLUDE`
* The content type must be compatible*
|Compress text-based resources using GZIP
|===

*Compatible content types: `text/html`, `text/css`, `application/x-javascript`, `application/javascript`, `text/javascript`, `text/plain`, `text/xml`, `application/xhtml+xml`, `image/svg+xml`

==== 14.3.5. `ReportAlertPostHandler`

[cols="3,^1,10a,10"]
|===
|Type |Rank |Condition(s) |Role

|Pre-handler 
|30
|* <<opt-tool.alert.reporting, `tool.alert.reporting`>> enabled
* `text/html` content type only
|Update the response with potential <<13-1-alert-reporting, alerts>>
|===

==== 14.3.6. `CacheHeaderPostHandler`

[cols="3,^1,10a,10"]
|===
|Type |Rank |Condition(s) |Role

|Pre-handler 
|40 
|All content types except `text/html`
|Position HTTP headers on responses
|===

==== 14.3.7. `DebuggerPostHandler`

[cols="3,^1,10a,10"]
|===
|Type |Rank |Condition(s) |Role

|Pre-handler 
|50 
|* <<opt-tool.debugger, `tool.debugger`>> enabled
* `text/html` content type only
|Override the response with the <<13-2-live-debugger, live debugger>>
|===

=== 14.4. Plugging-in your own handler

In order to plug-in your own handler, follow these steps:

. Create a class that extends `AbstractHandlerChain`

+
[source, java]
----
package com.foo.handler.impl;

   @Override
   public boolean isAfterChaining() {
      // true for post-handlers, false for pre-handlers 
      return false; <1>
   }

   @Override
   public int getRank() {
      return 0; <2>
   }

   @Override
   public boolean isApplicable(HandlerContext context) {
      return false; <3>
   }

   @Override
   protected Logger getLogger() {
      return null; <4>
   }

   @Override
   protected boolean handle(HandlerContext context) {
      // Processes the request/response
      return false; <5>
   }
----
<1> This handler is considered as a pre-handler
<2> Set the rank with which the handler will be executed in the chain
<3> Configure the conditions under which this handler applies
<4> Return the logger if you need logging
<5> Perform the request processing here. The return value is a boolean that indicates whether the handler chain should continue handling the request/response or not

. In the `META-INF/services` folder, create a text file (UTF-8 encoded) using the following convention:

+
.Example with a Maven project
[source, xml]
----
project-root
|__ src
   |__ main
      |__ resources
         |__ META-INF
            |__ services
               |__ com.github.dandelion.core.web.handler.HandlerChain
----

+
Inside this file, just add the fully qualified name of your own implementation. For example:

 com.foo.handler.impl.MyHandler

And that's all! Thanks to the SPI mechanism, Dandelion will automatically pick up your implementation and insert it in the handler chain at the position defined by its rank.
