# Contributing to Dandelion

Do you want to contribute your work to Dandelion? Well, then first and most important: **THANK YOU**!

Now, in order to accept your contribution, there are some terms you must expressly agree with, so please read them carefully. They might look a bit cumbersome, but they are here just in order to protect you, your contribution, and especially the **project's future**.

Important: submitting any contributions to the Dandelion project implies your full acceptance of these terms, including the "Dandelion Individual Contributor License Agreement" detailed at the end.

## Who can contribute?

Anyone, with the unique condition that he/she must be a **private individual**, acting in 
his/her own name, and not being endorsed in their contributed work by any company or government.

Note that this condition will not only refer to the ownership of the effort invested in contributing 
to the project, but also to the fact that *no private or public company will be mentioned as a a part 
of your contribution on the project's website or code*, including but not limited to web/email addresses 
or package names.

First of all, **get in touch with the [project members](http://dandelion.github.io/team/)** (an email or a topic in the forum should do) to talk about 
your ideas: new features, fixes, documentation... whatever you would like to contribute to the project. Let we 
discuss the possibilities with you so that we make sure your contribution goes in the right direction and aligns 
with the project's standards, intentions and roadmap.

## How to contribute?

Your contributions will have the form of GitHub *pull requests*.

Also, please understand that *not all pull requests will be accepted and merged into the project's 
repositories*. Talking about your planned contributions with the project members before creating pull requests
will maximize the possibilities of your contributions being accepted.

Once your contribution is approved, you will be listed as a *contributor* at the 
[Dandelion Team page](http://dandelion.github.io/team/). You can opt-out of this if you want. 
Also, you will be `@author` for any new Java classes that you write and also co-`@author` to any existing classes to 
which you make significant changes. You can also opt-out of this if you want.  

## Pay special attention to this

All Dandelion software is distributed under the **BSD 3-Clause** ("BSD New" or "BSD Simplified") open source license, and your contributions
will be licensed in the same way.

If you work for a company which, by the way or place in which your code was written, by your contract terms 
or by the laws in your country, could claim any rights (including but not limited to intellectual or industrial 
property) over your contributed code, you will have to send the project members (either by email from your 
authorised superiors or by signed fax), a statement indicating that your company agrees with the terms 
explained in this page, and that it both authorises your contribution to Dandelion and states that will 
never claim any kind of rights over it.
